    "\n",
    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy."

    "* **Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a correlation among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals."

    "#### Correlating.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know how well does each feature correlate with Survival. We want to do this early in our project and match these quick correlations with modelled correlations later in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to complete Age feature as it is definitely correlated to survival.\n",
    "We may want to complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correcting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ticket feature may be dropped from our analysis as it contains high ratio of duplicates (22%) and there may not be a correlation between Ticket and survival.\n",
    "Cabin feature may be dropped as it is highly incomplete or contains many null values both in training and test dataset.\n",
    "PassengerId may be dropped from training dataset as it does not contribute to survival.\n",
    "Name feature is relatively non-standard, may not contribute directly to survival, so maybe dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to create a new feature called Family based on Parch and SibSp to get total count of family members on board.\n",
    "We may want to engineer the Name feature to extract Title as a new feature.\n",
    "We may want to create new feature for Age bands. This turns a continous numerical feature into an ordinal categorical feature.\n",
    "We may also want to create a Fare range feature if it helps our analysis.\n",

    "#### Classifying.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Analyze by pivoting features\n",
    "To confirm some of our observations and assumptions, we can quickly analyze our feature correlations by pivoting features against each other. We can only do so at this stage for features which do not have any empty values. It also makes sense doing so only for features which are categorical (Sex), ordinal (Pclass) or discrete (SibSp, Parch) type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pclass** We observe significant correlation (>0.5) among Pclass=1 and Survived (classifying #3). We decide to include this feature in our model.\n",
    "* **Sex** We confirm the observation during problem definition that Sex=female had very high survival rate at 74% (classifying #1).\n",
    "* **SibSp and Parch** These features have zero correlation for certain values. It may be best to derive a feature or a set of features from these individual features (creating #1)."
